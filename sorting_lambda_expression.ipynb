Before, all the values we have passed as parameters have been pretty easy to understand: numbers, strings, lists, Booleans, dictionaries.

Instead, it is just bound to the formal parameter key of the function sorted.\n",

When a value is provided for that parameter in an invocation of the function sorted, it has to be a function. What the sorted function does is call that key function once for each item in the list that’s getting sorted. It associates the result returned by that function (the absolute function in our case) with the original value. Think of those associated values as being little post-it notes that decorate the original values. The value 4 has a post-it note that says 4 on it, but the value -2 has a post-it note that says 2 on it. Then the sorted function rearranges the original items in order of the values written on their associated post-it notes."

    "For our second sort order, the property we want to sort by is the number of cities that begin with the letter ‘S’. The function defining this property is harder to express, requiring a filter and count accumulation pattern. So we are better off defining a separate, named function. Here, we’ve chosen to make a lambda expression that looks up the value associated with the particular state and pass that value to the named function s_cities_count. We could have passed just the key, but then the function would have to look up the value, and it would be a little confusing, from the code, to figure out what dictionary the key is supposed to be looked up in. Here, we’ve done the lookup right in the lambda expression, which makes it a little bit clearer that we’re just sorting the keys of the states dictionary based on a property of their values. It also makes it easier to reuse the counting function on other city lists, even if they aren’t embedded in that particular states dictionary.\n",
